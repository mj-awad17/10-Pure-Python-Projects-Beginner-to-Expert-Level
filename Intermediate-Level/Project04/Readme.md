## 🗺️ ASCII Map

```text
            [Tower]
               |
    [Hut] -- [Forest] -- [River]
               |
            [Cave]

You begin in the Forest, and your goal is to reach the Tower, but you’ll need to collect:
```

* 🗡️ Sword (hidden in the Cave)

* 🛡️ Shield (guarded near the River)

* <img src="https://cdn3.emoji.gg/emojis/6584-armor-1065537.png" alt="Armor" width="20"/> Armor (tucked away in the Hut)

Only then can you unlock the Tower and claim the Crystal of Light 💎!
