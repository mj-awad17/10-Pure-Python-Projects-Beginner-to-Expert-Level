# Caesar Cipher Implementation

# This script implements a simple Caesar cipher encryption and decryption.
def case_cipher():
    pass

# This function takes a string and a shift value, and returns the encrypted/decrypted string.
"""
Steps to implement the process_file function:
1. Open the file in read mode.
2. Read the contents of the file.
3. Process the content using the case_cipher function.
4. Create the output file directory if it doesn't exist.
5. Write the processed content to the output file.
6. Handle any exceptions that may occur during file operations.
7. Return a success message or an error message.
