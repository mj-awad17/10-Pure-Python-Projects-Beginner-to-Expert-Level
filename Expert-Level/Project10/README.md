## ðŸ§  What You'll Learn

This expert-level project covers complex programming concepts:

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Parsing` | Formula and cell reference parsing |
| `Graph Theory` | Dependency tracking between cells |
| `Caching` | Optimizing cell value calculations |
| `Regular Expressions` | Processing cell references |
| `Error Handling` | Managing formula evaluation errors |

## ðŸ›  Features

âœ… Cell references (e.g., A1, B2)  
âœ… Formula support (e.g., =A1+B2)  
âœ… Automatic recalculation  
âœ… Dependency tracking  
âœ… Error handling  
âœ… Dynamic column sizing  
âœ… Interactive command interface

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

The spreadsheet processor:

1. Maintains a grid of cells with values or formulas
2. Tracks dependencies between cells
3. Automatically updates dependent cells
4. Handles circular references
5. Provides a clean command-line interface
